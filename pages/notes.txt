# Systems and Inequality

Most systems tend to benefit one group before another. And in the current world there is a lot of inequality
in terms of power, competence, and resources. The reason for that is the positive feedback loop that associated
with current systems. For example, if you have a lot of money, you usually can earn even more because of that. 
On other hand it's barely the case when a poor person becomes very rich. And we see this rule everywhere: 
the more you have - the more you get. 

In human history, there was moments where people tried to tackle that problem, but all of them ended up 
disastrously, like soviet and china's communism. It's because that they usually just punished the most 
productive workers, which wasn't the best idea. However, someone might say that you could become 
successful purely based on your skills and competence. But to get them you usually need the right people 
and a resources, which not all people might have. 

Yes, with the rules we have, eventually some people will adapt to them and utilize them for their benefit, 
while others have no any idea what they should do nor resources for that to get off from the pit. 
We can't change human nature, but... what if we change the rules itself? And not in the way that benefits 
some group, but benefits everyone?

This where the culling game kicks in. 

# How The Culling Game works

The idea is to create a system with initial set of rules, and allow users to change rules.

This project aims to test the above idea with a simple game. The game is a decentralized system built around 
collectible NFTs representing cards with unique properties. 

Each user gotta buy cards at the start when registering. There is no limit on 
cards amount a user can have, although you can play only with 12 cards in each battle. 
The user can use the properties of a card to defeat other cards. 

There are two rulesets. First, the rules for cards' properties. Second are meta rules. 
Meta rules are the rules of game itself, and usually require developer knowledge for that. 
Also, each rule is voted by all users to be accepted. Rule is accepted if 
supermajority of user voted for it. 

So far it looks like a usual Gacha or Gwent game. However, there is one feature that makes it completely 
unique: it's possible to change the rules of game. Players begin with a basic set of cards and
the player who got enough tokens will receive "the honored one" status. The honored one can propose new rules.
You can get tokens either by winning battles or you can sell your cards for them. 

So, the trick is that when you accept the new rules, its applied for each user's card, which means that 
value of card shifts, and if you lucky, the rules can make your deck stronger and more valuable.

## Rules for Rules 
 But how we control to what extend users can change the rules? That's the most important part. First of all,
 the new rules should be fair for most users without the benefiting the person who proposed it. For that,
 we can either set a domain of possible changes, or we can make voting for each rule. 
 The disadventage of the first approach is that it's hard to predict all possible rules, also limiting the 
 freedom of users to choose rules. The disadventage of the second approach is that user can vote for the
 rules that might be unreasonable and user who did not exemine the rules careful, might make a wrong choice.

 For the test version I will use the first approach, but I will consider the second approach for the future.
 Basically, there will be a list of available rules the honoroed user can choose from and apply to any card 
 (includeding to one he don't hold) without approval of supermajority of users.

 ## Cards 
The cards will have following attributes:
 - Name - the name of the card
 - Points (1-10) - the higher the points, the more scores it will have. It also the field of HP 
 - Rarity (1-10) - the chance of getting this Clipboard, where 1 - is common cards and 10 is very rare cards 
 - Ability - some of the cards might have a special ability that can be used in the battle.

All of above attributes are mutable, and can be changed by the honored one (the user who scored some 
number of points). The price of the card is calculated based on the attributes of the card, and can be 
sold to get the innate tokens.
