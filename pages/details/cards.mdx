# Cards

Cards are the core building blocks of The Culling Game.  Each card is an NFT that possesses unique attributes influencing its power, value, and strategic potential.

## Key Attributes

* **Name:** A descriptive title for the card.  This is primarily for thematic and identification purposes.

* **Points (1-10):** This multipurpose attribute represents:
    * **Health Points (HP):**  The amount of damage a card can take before being defeated in battle.
    * **Base Score:** Points contribute to a card's score, determining battle outcomes. Higher points typically mean stronger cards.

* **Rarity (1-10):** Indicates the relative scarcity of a card.
    * **Common (1):**  Easy to obtain.
    * **Very Rare (10):** Highly sought-after and difficult to find.
    * Rarity influences market value and often correlates with stronger abilities.

* **Ability:**  Optional special actions or effects a card may have during battle. Abilities add diverse strategies and create unexpected outcomes.  Examples include:
    * Damage buffs/debuffs
    * Healing
    * Bypassing certain defenses

## Mutability

* **Honored Ones:** Players who earn this status can alter any of the above attributes 
(Name, Points, Rarity, Ability) for existing cards. Note: 
Changes are likely subject to **community approval** or **pre-set modification lists.**

## Card Value

A card's price is dynamic, influenced by:

* **Attributes:** Stronger cards (high points, rare abilities) command higher prices.
* **Market Demand:**  Popularity and strategic metagame trends also affect value. 
* **Rule Changes:**  Shifts in the rules can dramatically increase or decrease a card's value and desirability.
