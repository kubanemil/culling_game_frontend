# Systems and Inequality

Most systems tend to benefit one group before another. And in the current world there is a lot of inequality
in terms of power, competence, and resources. The reason for that is the positive feedback loop that associated
with current systems. For example, if you have a lot of money, you usually can earn even more because of that. On 
other hand it's barely the case when a poor person becomes very rich. And we see this rule everywhere: the more you have -
the more you get. 

In human history, there was moments where people tried to tackle that problem, but all of them ended up disastrously, like 
soviet and china's communism. It's because that they usually just punished the most productive workers, which wasn't the best idea.
However, someone might say that you could become successful purely based on your skills and competence. But to get them you usually 
need the right people and a resources, which not all people might have. 

Yes, with the rules we have, eventually some people will adapt to them and utilize them for their benefit, while others have no 
any idea what they should do nor resources for that to get off from the pit. We can't change human nature, but... what if we change 
the rules itself? And not in the way that benefits some group, but benefits everyone?

This where the culling game kicks in. The idea is to create a system with some basic backbone rules, and allow users to add additional
rules and vote for their acceptance. Here's how the culling game works.

# How The Culling Game works

The idea of this DAO is to create an NFT of cards with some properties. 

Each user gotta receive theme at the start when registering. There is no limit on 
cards amount a user can have, although you can play only with 12 cards in each battle. 
The user can use the properties of a card to defeat other cards. 

There are two rulesets. First, the rules for cards' properties. Second are meta rules. 
Meta rules are the rules of game itself, and usually require developer knowledge for that. 
Also, each rule is voted by all users to be accepted. Rule is accepted if 
supermajority of user voted for it. 

So far it looks like a usual Gacha or Gwent game. However, there is one feature that makes it completely unique: it’s possible to change the rules of game. Any player can add new rules if they don’t violate previous rules, and if they have enough tokens for that. You can get tokens either winning battles and getting the stake, or you can sell your cards for them. 

So, the trick is that when you accept the new rules, its applied for each user's card, which means that value of card shifts, and if you lucky, the rules can make your deck from the weakest to the strongest.
