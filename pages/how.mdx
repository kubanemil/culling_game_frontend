**The Culling Game** is a unique collectible card game where players can change the rules. 
It's designed to be a living game, evolving based on community decisions.

## How it Works

* **Start as a Collector:** When you join, you buy NFT cards with various properties. 
Build a deck of 12 cards to use in battles against other players.
* **Card Properties Matter:** Each card has points (health), rarity (how hard it is to obtain), 
and sometimes a special ability. These determine a card's strength and how much it's worth.
* **Earn and Propose:**  Win battles or sell cards to earn tokens. If you get enough tokens, 
you become "the honored one" and can propose new rules for cards.
* **Community Votes:** Rules only change if the majority of players approve.  This keeps the game 
fair and stops anyone from gaining too much power.

## Why is This Unique?

Usually, game developers are the only ones who can change the rules. In The Culling Game, *you* 
can shape how the game works.  When new rules pass, your cards might become stronger, weaker, 
or gain new abilities â€“ this can totally shift their value!  

## Controlling the Changes

To keep the game balanced, we're starting with a more guided approach. 
"Honored ones" can only select from a pre-set list of rule changes. 
Later, we might explore a system where anyone can propose a rule and the community votes on it directly.
