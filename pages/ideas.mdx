# Ideas list

Here is the list of ideas that might be implemented in a future version of the Culling Game:
 - Currently the honored one can only change the property of the cards. 
But we also should allow the honored one to change the rules of the game. The problem is that
the rules are the piece of code in the smart contract, so user should have the coding background.
 - It's possible to add AI that will validate and convert user's ideas into the code. For this option 
 a voting for proposed rule is mandatory.
 - It's also possible to the honored one share some token with trusted developer to write the code for 
 the new rule.
